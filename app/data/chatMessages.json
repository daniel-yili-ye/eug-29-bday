You’ve become such a steady, joy-filled part of my life - someone who’s easy to laugh with, talk to, and just do life alongside. I’ve loved getting to make so many memories together, especially with you, Jordan, and Daniel. Whether it’s random hangouts, trying out new foods, or our Vancouver trip, those moments have honestly been some of my favourites.\nIt’s been really beautiful watching how much you’ve grown!!!  I’ve seen so much growth especially in your faith and in how you’ve walked through so many changes this past year. Moving back to Mississauga, navigating things with your parents, and now stepping into this new season with Daniel are some big changes that you’ve been going through and you’ve handled it all with such grace, faith, and strength.\n\n I am super excited for you in this next year of your life!!! Seeing your story unfold from single to dating and now engaged has been so so special!!!  You and Daniel complement each other so well with your humour, care for each other, and it’s been amazing seeing you two grow together while serving and building community. I’m so excited for all that’s ahead: the wedding planning, the marriage, and everything God has in store for you both.\nYou’re such a one-of-a-kind human - quirky, grounded, and genuinely caring. You bring so much laughter and light wherever you go (and of course, you’ll always be one of da bois 😎).\n\nPraying this next year brings you even more joy, peace, and little reminders of how deeply loved and supported you are by God and by everyone around you. So proud of who you are, Eug, and grateful I get to call you a friend and a sister 💛 To more cheers 👀!!!! OKEY OKEY OKEY 🤩",

Your genuine care for your friends and patients are so evident by how you check-in, how your remember, and you have this special gift of making those around you so loved. I LOVE laughing with you, joking with you, having picnics with you and just calling / texting with you to catch up. I love how you are SO CHILL always, even though you literally save lives and are actually a HUGE deal, yet you're so welcoming and down to earth. Words cannot fully express how much I love you, but know that it's A LOT and I am forever grateful that God let me meet a sister in Christ like you. Here's to many more years of celebrating your beautiful God glorifying life together. I love you ❤️",

I also truly admire your empathy towards others and how you deeply care for your friends / family. I have a lot to learn from you.\n\nCheers to another year around the sun my love, I look forward to serving God's kingdom with you each day and catching many noise complaints from our neighbours in Rochasesvalle 😚.\n\nMuch Muah’s!\nDan",
